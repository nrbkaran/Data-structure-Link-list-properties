Data Structures: Linked List Implementation in C
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of various linked list functionalities using the C programming language. It serves as a learning resource for understanding how linked lists work and how to perform common operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

Features
Singly Linked List
Node Creation: Dynamic allocation of nodes in a linked list.
Insertion:
At the beginning
At the end
At a specific position
Deletion:
By value
By position
Traversal: Display all elements in the linked list.
Searching: Find an element in the list.
Reversal: Reverse the linked list.
Doubly Linked List
Node Creation: Dynamic allocation of nodes with pointers to both next and previous nodes.
Insertion:
At the beginning
At the end
At a specific position
Deletion:
By value
By position
Traversal: Display all elements in the list forwards and backwards.
Searching: Find an element in the list.
Reversal: Reverse the linked list.
Circular Linked List
Node Creation: Circular linked list node implementation.
Insertion:
At the beginning
At the end
Deletion:
By value
By position
Traversal: Display all elements in the circular linked list.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
A C compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
Basic knowledge of C programming
